# Snake Game with Reinforcement Learning

In This repository, Snake game is implemented with Q-learning and Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm)

[Snake](https://pygame-learning-environment.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/games/snake.html) is a game where the agent must maneuver a line which grows in length each time food is touched by the head of the segment. The line follows the previous paths taken which eventually become obstacles for the agent to avoid.

The food is randomly spawned inside of the valid window while checking it does not make contact with the snake body.
